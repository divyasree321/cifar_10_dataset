# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a deep learning-based image classification model for the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- Loading and exploring the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Preprocessing and normalizing image data
- Building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification
- Training the model and tracking performance
- Evaluating the trained model on test data
- Visualizing accuracy, loss curves, and model predictions

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The CNN model achieves promising accuracy in classifying images into one of the ten CIFAR-10 classes. The notebook includes evaluation metrics, accuracy/loss graphs, and sample predictions for visual validation.

## ðŸ“š File Included
- `Image_classification_using_cifar_10_dataset.ipynb` : Google Colab notebook containing full code implementation, outputs, and visualizations.

## ðŸ”— How to Run
- Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
- Run all cells sequentially
- Review training results, accuracy, loss curves, and sample predictions
